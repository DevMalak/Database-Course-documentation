answer question 1

🗂 Structure
Flat file systems store data in a single file, often in plain text formats like CSV or TSV. Each line typically represents a record, and fields are separated by delimiters. There’s no enforced schema, and structure is implicit. Relational databases, on the other hand, organize data into multiple tables with defined columns, data types, and constraints. These tables are linked using keys, and the structure is explicitly defined through a schema.

🔁 Data Redundancy
Flat files often suffer from high data redundancy. Since there’s no normalization, the same data (e.g., customer name or product ID) may be repeated across many records. Relational databases reduce redundancy through normalization. Data is split into related tables, and repeated values are replaced with references (foreign keys), minimizing duplication.

🔗 Relationships
Flat file systems do not support relationships natively. If you want to link data (e.g., customers to orders), you must manually manage references, which is error-prone and hard to maintain. Relational databases are designed to handle relationships. You can define one-to-many, many-to-many, and hierarchical relationships using primary and foreign keys, and query them using JOIN operations.

🧪 Example Usage
Flat files are suitable for simple tasks like configuration files, logs, or exporting/importing data between systems. They’re easy to read and write but limited in functionality. Relational databases are used in complex systems like banking, hospital management, e-commerce, and ERP platforms where data integrity, scalability, and multi-user access are critical.

⚠️ Drawbacks
Flat file systems lack features like indexing, concurrency control, and data integrity enforcement. They’re not scalable and can become inconsistent with large or multi-user datasets. Relational databases require careful design and setup. They introduce complexity and overhead, especially for small or temporary tasks. However, they offer robustness, scalability, and powerful querying capabilities.

answer question 3

Roles in a database system

System analyst: Translates business needs into system requirements and data flows; collaborates across stakeholders.

Database designer: Defines the data model, entities, relationships, constraints, and overall schema to meet requirements.

Database developer: Implements schema objects, queries, views, triggers, functions, and performance tuning across environments.

DBA (admin): Authorizes access, monitors usage, ensures backups/recovery, capacity planning, and availability.

Application developer: Integrates applications with the database via ORM/SQL, designs APIs, and ensures transactional correctness.

BI developer: Builds ETL/ELT pipelines, semantic models, dashboards, and analytics artifacts on top of curated data.

answer question 4

1. Types of Databases
Relational vs Non-Relational (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

Relational databases store data in structured tables with rows and columns and use SQL for queries.
Non-relational databases store data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column models (e.g., MongoDB and Cassandra).
Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases
Centralized databases store all data in one location.
Distributed databases store data across multiple servers or locations.
Cloud databases are hosted on cloud platforms and managed by providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Use case examples

Relational: banking systems, inventory, ERP.
Non-relational: IoT, social media feeds, analytics.
Centralized: small business applications.
Distributed: global applications requiring high availability.
Cloud databases: scalable web apps, SaaS platforms.

2. Cloud Storage and Databases
What is Cloud Storage and how does it relate to databases?

Cloud storage is remote storage for files, backups, and unstructured data. It relates to databases because it often stores large objects or backups while the database stores structured metadata about those objects.

Advantages of using cloud-based databases

Automatic backups, high availability, easy scaling, no hardware maintenance, global accessibility.

Disadvantages of using cloud-based databases

Higher long-term cost, possible latency, dependency on internet connection, provider lock-in, limited control over hardware.

3. Database Engines and Languages
What is a Database Engine?

A database engine is the underlying software responsible for storing, retrieving, and processing data, executing queries, and managing transactions.

Examples: SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL

SQL Server uses the SQL Server Engine.
MySQL uses engines such as InnoDB.
Oracle uses the Oracle Database Engine.
PostgreSQL uses the PostgreSQL Engine.

What languages do they use? (e.g., T-SQL, PL/SQL, ANSI SQL)
SQL Server uses T-SQL.
Oracle uses PL/SQL.
PostgreSQL uses PL/pgSQL (along with standard SQL).
MySQL uses a dialect based on ANSI SQL.

Is there a relationship between the engine and the language?
Yes. Each engine supports standard SQL but also provides its own extended dialect for procedures, triggers, and system functions.

Can one language work across different engines?

Basic SQL works across engines, but engine-specific languages (such as T-SQL or PL/SQL) do not work across systems without rewriting.

4. Can We Transfer a Database Between Engines?
Is it possible to migrate a database from SQL Server to MySQL, or Oracle to PostgreSQL?

Yes, migration is possible, but it requires careful conversion.

What are the challenges of engine-to-engine migration?

Differences in data types, SQL dialects, stored procedures, triggers, indexing methods, and vendor-specific features.

What should we consider before transferring (data types, triggers, stored procedures, etc.)?

You must evaluate data types, rewrite stored procedures, adjust triggers, modify constraints, update indexing strategies, and confirm application compatibility.

5. Logical vs. Physical Schema
What is the Logical Schema in database design?

It is the conceptual structure describing entities, attributes, and relationships, independent of physical storage.

What is the Physical Schema?

It is the actual implementation of the database, including tables, data types, indexes, and storage details.

What’s the difference between them?

The logical schema describes what the data represents, while the physical schema describes how the data is stored and optimized.

Why is it important to understand both?

Understanding both ensures accurate data modeling (logical) and efficient performance and storage (physical).

Example: Show how one entity (e.g., Student) would appear in both logical and physical schemas

Logical schema: Student has attributes such as StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Email, DateOfBirth, and Major.
Physical schema: A table named Students with defined data types (e.g., INT for StudentID, VARCHAR for names), constraints (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE), and optional indexes.
